Hi! I am **Simran Makhija** 🙋🏻‍♀️ Nice to meet you 🤝
I am a final year **Computer Science & Engineering** student from Indore, India.👩‍💻

I am an explorer in tech and have mostly worked in _front-end development_ so far and have dabbled around in some _product designing, cloud computing and software architecture_.🙂

I am an active member of various _tech communities_ and am a part of a few community programs, namely _Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors and GitHub campus experts_.👥🌸

Currently, I have taken up the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. I will be using this blog to document the journey here on out!

Thank you for dropping by!🌸
